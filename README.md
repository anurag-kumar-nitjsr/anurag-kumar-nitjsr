I'm Anurag Kumar, a passionate and creative front-end developer with over 1.5 years of experience in crafting engaging, user-friendly websites and applications. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have a strong grasp of frameworks like React and Spring.

My journey began with a simple curiosity for how websites work, which quickly turned into a passion for web development. I love the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions and believe that a great user experience starts with a clean, responsive design.

I've had the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients, from startups to large corporations, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas and learn from others.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest web technologies or sharing my knowledge with budding developers. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

Let's create something amazing together!
